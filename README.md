# React Material-UI Dashboard

This is a dashboard template built with React and Material-UI. It includes several customizable components and scenes, such as charts, tables, forms, and a login page. It can be used as a starter kit for building admin panels, data visualization tools, or any other web applications that require a clean and modern design.

## Demo
